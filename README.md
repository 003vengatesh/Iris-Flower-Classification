# Iris Flower Classification 🌸🔍

Welcome to the Iris Flower Classification project repository! This project focuses on classifying iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements using machine learning techniques.

## Introduction ℹ️

This project aims to analyze the Iris dataset and build predictive models to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Aspiring Data Scientists will find this project informative for learning data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model selection, and evaluation.

## Dataset 📊

The Iris dataset contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, and species for 150 iris flowers.

## Dependencies 🛠️

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed in your environment:
- pandas==1.3.3
- seaborn==0.11.2
- matplotlib==3.4.3
- scikit-learn==0.24.2

You can install them using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Project Structure 📁

The project consists of the following components:
- Importing Libraries
- Loading Data
- Data Preprocessing
- Data Analysis
- Train-Test Split
- Model Selection
- Model Performance Evaluation
- Final Model Selection

## Getting Started 🚀

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook `Iris_Flower_Classification.ipynb` to follow along with the project.
4. Explore, modify, and experiment with the code to enhance your understanding and skills.

## Model Selection 🤖

Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated for this project:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine
- K-Nearest Neighbors

Based on the evaluation metrics, the K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier was selected as the final model due to its superior performance.

## Model Performance 📊

K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier:
- R2 Score: 1.0
- Accuracy Score: 1.0
